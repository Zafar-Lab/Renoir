# RENOIR

RENOIR is an information-theory-based scoring metric that delineates spatial communication domains that are cell-type, ligand, and target specific. It also identifies spatially enriched ligand-target gene sets and characterizes domain-specific activities between ligands and targets.

### Requirements
**Note**: All requirements are provided in the renoir.yml file. Specific libraries required for the neighborhood score computation and downstream tasks are as follows,

- scanpy (1.9.1)
- numpy (1.21.6)
- numba (0.56.4)
- pandas (1.2.5)
- scipy (1.7.1)
- hdbscan (0.8.28)
- dynamictreecut (0.1.1)
- sklearn (0.24.2)
- seaborn (0.11.1)
- matplotlib (0.11.7)

### Installation
**Note**: Installation does not include cell2location. Please install cell2location separately.

- Download the repository and install the conda environment using `conda env create -f renoir.yml`
- Install Renoir by cd to this directory and running `pip install .`
